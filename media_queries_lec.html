<!--Media queries are generally perceived as the most important tool in your belt when it comes to building a responsive website.
They allow you to target CSS based on the pixel width of the viewable area and make changes based on those dimensions.

@Media is used to define a media query in CSS. Allows you to specify different styles for different media types.
screen specifies that the media type targeted by this query is a computer screen.
And is used to combine multiple media features within a single media query.
Min-width:500px is a feature that checks the minimum width of the viewport.
    /* screen sizes 500px and up */
@media screen and (min-width:500px) {
    selector {
      property: value;
  }
}
-->
<!--
/* screen sizes between 960px and 1200px */
@media screen and (min-width:960px) and (max-width:1200px) {
/* ... */
}
-->

<!-- Breakpoints are what we refer to as major resolution changes, which you specify with media queries,
usually based on popular device configurations. They are called breakpoints because traditionally major layout elements are broken and repositioned,
though not always the case, and the name stuck.

/* Small devices (phones and pocket devices, 576 and up) */
@media screen and (min-width:576px) { /* ... */ }

/* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media screen and (min-width:768px) { /* ... */ }

/* Large devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media screen and (min-width:992px) { /* ... */ }

/* Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media screen and (min-width:1200px) { /* ... */ }
